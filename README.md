# Face Recognition

Facial Recognition System Using Deep Learning

## About the Internship

<p align="justify">

This work was done by me as a part of summer internship 2019-20 at my University NIT Surat under [Dr. K.P.Upla](https://sites.google.com/site/kpupla/home). I began my journey in Deep Learning through this internship and worked on the FaceNet system proposed by Google.

</p>

<p>
Worked on different submodules like Face Detection, Face Alignment and recognition through FaceNet's Inception model and carried out experiments on custom made dataset of 25 students.
</p>

## System Overview
<p>

</p>

1. Face detection in a video frame 
2. Cropping and aligning the detected faces. 
3. Face Recognition using CNN Model.
